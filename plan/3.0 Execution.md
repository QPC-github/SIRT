## 3.1 - Tech Stack section, deployment and maintenance

The selection of the IT and communications infrastructure is necessary to deliver our services, and make a plan for its deployment, operational availability, and security assurance is included here. That work is dependent on :x: [2.1](https://github.com/ossf/SIRT/blob/main/plan/2.0%20Identify%20Core%20Services%20and%20Processes.md#21---identify-a-core-set-of-services) as it will determine the scope of this work. We can proceed a bit, but will have to wait at some point.

- **M1**: _Tech stack selection_
  - [ ] Discovery and documentation --> issue#
  - [ ] Election of tech --# issue#
- **M2**: _Deployment_
  - [ ] ...
- **M3**: _Operational needs fullfilled_
  - [ ] ...


## 3.2 Recruitment

Depending on the operational model defineb by :x: [2.3](https://github.com/ossf/SIRT/blob/main/plan/2.0%20Identify%20Core%20Services%20and%20Processes.md#23-define-expectations-including-vetting-process-and-ethics-agreement-and-determine-the-necessary-skills-and-experience-that-will-be-required-of-each-incident-responder-as-part-of-the-sirts-processes-onboarding-and-shadowing-programs), we will have to hire folks, or recruit volunteers. The actual content of the job requirement will then be defined by :x: [2.1](https://github.com/ossf/SIRT/blob/main/plan/2.0%20Identify%20Core%20Services%20and%20Processes.md#22-define-conditions-and-triage-criteria-for-the-services-offered-by-the-sirt-this-list-will-be-maintained-and-actively-updated-in-a-centralized-public-location-on-the-internet) and :x: [2.4](https://github.com/ossf/SIRT/blob/main/plan/2.0%20Identify%20Core%20Services%20and%20Processes.md#24-design-an-engagement-model-for-incident-responders-which-addresses-things-such-as), so we have lots of blockers here.

## 3.3 Documentation and Training for the SIRT

In order to perform the duties of the SIRT properly, we will need both playbooks and onboarding and training materials. This should be addressed early, before we are fully operational so we can iteratively improve on it. The **onboarding** documentation will depend on :x: [2.1](https://github.com/ossf/SIRT/blob/main/plan/2.0%20Identify%20Core%20Services%20and%20Processes.md#22-define-conditions-and-triage-criteria-for-the-services-offered-by-the-sirt-this-list-will-be-maintained-and-actively-updated-in-a-centralized-public-location-on-the-internet) and the **playbooks** will be greatly influenced by :x: [2.4](https://github.com/ossf/SIRT/blob/main/plan/2.0%20Identify%20Core%20Services%20and%20Processes.md#24-design-an-engagement-model-for-incident-responders-which-addresses-things-such-as).

- **M1**: Onboarding documentation v1.0
  - [ ] Skeleton-draft available to join the SIRT team
- **M2**: Operational playbooks v1.0


## 3.4 Define and report on key metrics

In order to better understand our successes and impact in year one1, we need metrics and reports about the work done. This objective aims to identify (Service Level Indicators), and then measure (Service Level Objectives) ourselves against these. Reports should be presented to the the [TAC](https://github.com/ossf/tac) on a regular basis.

## 3.5 Establish a post mortem culture

Documenting lessons learned from handled incidents in order to mature the Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure processes (CVD) with feedback provided to other working groups such as the Best Practices WG, Vuln Disc WG and other existing organizations operating in the incident response world.
