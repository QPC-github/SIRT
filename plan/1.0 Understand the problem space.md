## 1.1 Understand and document the problem space

Explanation: In order for the SIRT to narrow and define the breadth of services it offers, we must first understand the current problems as expressed by the various types of open source projects. To that end, an initial high level summary of these problems is as follows and will be leveraged to verify the services offered assist in addressing the problems where reasonable and appropriate.

* There exists open source projects and communities that are culturally adverse to applying security changes as the software they make available makes no guarantees, is hobbyist, or is not intended to become critical.
* Security implementation is often a single point of failure, lack of like knowledge in that domain as it applies to projects means that code or configuration is not capable of being maintained (becoming a security problem unto itself)
* “My adopters should know better” as a decision to exclude or not include least privilege, protections, or security design concepts made sense 20 years ago when innovation and commoditization of the technology was very early (high risk) but in as adoptions has exponentially increase, this mindset cannot necessarily persists. This is exacerbated by either the lack of documentation on assummed knowledge, or by developers not reading documentation - choosing to focus on shipping with velocity.
* Open source projects, and languages exist in their own silos, so communication inter-silo doesn’t occur. When incidents occur, there is no method for delivering messaging across silos. Like the lack of interstates scores ago, and the CDC needs to distribute vaccines across the country in one week.

### Key Steps/Milestones

* Survey representative project maintainers
    * **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Deliverables</span>** : Survey results that affirms or disputes the top level problems and clarifies, with detail, those problems
* Survey existing OSS Security Teams
    * Identified Security Teams
        * Homebrew (Randall)
        * Gentoo (Randall)
    * **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Deliverables</span>** : Survey results that affirms or disputes the top level problems and clarifies, with detail, those problems
* Speak to solardesigner/oss-sec lists
    * **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Deliverables</span>** : Survey results that affirms or disputes the top level problems and clarifies, with detail, those problems
* Review CERT CVD existing literature
    * Identified Existing Literature
        * [FIRST PSIRT Services Framework](https://www.first.org/standards/frameworks/psirts/psirt_services_framework_v1.1)
        * [FIRST CVD Guide ](https://www.first.org/global/sigs/vulnerability-coordination/multiparty/guidelines-v1.1)
        * [OSSF CVD Guides ](https://github.com/ossf/oss-vulnerability-guide)
        * [CERT CVD  Guide](https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/asset_files/specialreport/2017_003_001_503340.pdf)
        * OSWAP
    * **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Deliverables</span>** Summarization of top level problems
        * Review discussions and background on the Problems that have arisen from those docs.
        * Executive summary reviews - document key takeaways
* Speak with CERT-CC and other coordinators
    * Large multi-party coordination
    * Art and CRob have connections.
    * **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Deliverables</span>** : Survey results that affirms or disputes the top level problems and clarifies, with detail, those problems from the perspective of incident coordinating bodies

#### Time & resource estimate

This will require coordination with the OpenSSF to develop the survey based on this top level problem set. It will then require the SIG to comb through the analysis of this data set and develop a guiding report for development and feature-completeness of services.

Approx. 1 month of survey development, 2 weeks for coordination with OpenSSF, 3 weeks to solicit feedback on the survey 2 months of analysis, 3 weeks for developing the report, 1 month to refine existing services.

## 1.2 procedures around outreach to dev communities about our services

Explanation: through discussing our proposal with a representative set of open-source developers and security incident responders, with special attention to those with experience managing the disclosure and remediation of high impact vulnerabilities in open-source software. Essentially recapturing the intent of the services as being useful to the communities

### Key Steps/Milestones

* Likely needs coordination with the Outreach team at OpenSSF
* A slick sheet explaining services
* Contingent on lists from Stream 2 & 3
* Need to think through “marketing”/creative needs
* Document possible channels for outreach
* Create “rules of engagement” to ensure positive outcomes for community engagements

#### Time & resource estimate

* 1 month of slick sheet developmrn, contingent of design service available
* End of year 1, development of a website with listing of services and how to self-educate/learn more - 2 web developers + content developement + marketing
* Webinars, podcast, and blogs - contingent upon availability of EDU SIG to review final content. Needs content development, recording space, and publishing process

## 1.3 Assist maintainers through the SIRT’s offerings

Explanation: based on the SIRT’s defined engagement model, existing security groups, and criteria to the extent practically possible for the incident responders. The SIRT is prepared to assist and support at least ONE request for engagement and deliver a retrospective report at the end of year one to be used to iterate and improve for future engagements.

### Key Steps/Milestones

* Security Buddy Training development - 2-3 weeks
* SIRT process Training - 4-6 hrs of training/ documentation review
* Linux Foundations Training - Needs the defined list of courses approximately 4 hr
* Security Buddy presentation - development as it relates to the SIRT.  Dev Rel
* Identifying individuals to act as “Buddies” to present this and partner with maintainers.
* Developing list of projects to start.

#### Time & resource estimate

Developing the training for security buddy is about 2-3 weeks
SIRT process training development - 2-3 weeks
SIRT process training - 4-6 hrs per SIRT member
Linux Foundation Training - Defining the course list, about 1 meeting, completing the courses - 4 hrs per SIRT member
Estimate approximately 1 Month of Security buddy presentation development
Developing list of projects to start with - approximately 2 meetings
Coordinated outreach to initially identified projects - 2 weeks contact cycles, 8 hrs of high visibility engagement, about 1 hr of bi-weekly engagement spot-checks for 6 months (6 hrs per engagement cycle per project contingent upon contact cycle success).
