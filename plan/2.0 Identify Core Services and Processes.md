# 2.0 Identify core services and processes (focused on laying out team processes and services)

Work on defining the SIRT, what it does, and how it operates

## 2.1 - identify a core set of services
(was 2.0 <-- remove after agreed placement)
### Explanation: Document and prepare materials for maintainers to educate on services of the SIRT

### Key Steps/Milestones
- Support secure communications between maintainers, researchers and organizations when receiving vulnerability reports and/or proof-of-concept code (was 2.1 <-- remove after agreed placement)
- Communicating with security researchers and negotiating disclosure timelines (was 2.2 <-- remove after agreed placement)
- Experiment with providing subject matter experts (SME) to help with vetting and offering security expertise in order to help maintainers better understand the vulnerabilities and their  impact. (was 2.3 <-- remove after agreed placement)
Review proposed fixes before they are public to see if they fully resolve the reported vulnerabilities (was 2.4 <-- remove after agreed placement)
- When specifically requested by maintainers, assist in the creation of and/or review of proposed fixes before they are public so as to verify if they fully resolve the reported vulnerability; (to the best of the group’s ability). To minimize the likelihood of widespread vulnerability exploitation, the SIRT will assist maintainters with vulnerability coordination, the creation of security advisories, the creation of corresponding release notes, and publishing patches. [Not in scope for Year 1] (was 2.5<-- remove after agreed placement)
- Helping maintainers publish software patches, security advisories, and corresponding release notes in a way that will minimize the likelihood of widespread vulnerability exploitation and mis-interpretation. Provide tools, assistance, and guidance to maintainers in order to support coordination of vulnerabilities. [Not in scope for Year 1] (was 2.6<-- remove after agreed placement)
- Coordinating confidential and sensitive communications (as appropriate) with downstream affected projects to assist in a risk-mitigating approach to security patch deployment (was 2.7<-- remove after agreed placement)
- For year one, the SIRT will provide guidance and best practices documentation to maintainers on how to evaluate vulnerability reports in their open source project and react to zero-day exploitation reports. For year two and later, we will expand and start helping to evaluate and assist maintainers receiving reports of novel vulnerabilities and in-the-wild exploitation of vulnerabilities in their open source project.

## 2.2 Define conditions and triage criteria for the services offered by the SIRT. This list will be maintained and actively updated in a centralized, public location on the internet.

## 2.3 Define expectations (including vetting process and ethics agreement) and determine the necessary skills and /experience that will be required of each incident responder as part of the SIRT’s processes, onboarding, and shadowing programs.

(was 7.0 <-- remove after agreed placement)

### Explanation:  

### Key Steps/Milestones
- Define operational procedures including processes, tooling, training, and, 
on-call rotation logistics, including a higher-level set of processes around , how we ensure adequate service availability, define volunteering processes & rules, the upholding of commitments upheld by incident responders (including preventing premature disclosure “How-to” guides for those maintainers/developers wishing to engage with the SIRT), service level agreements (SLAs), and the definition a process fore engagement/interactions with Distros, & oss-security & existing security teams. (was 7.1 <-- remove after agreed placement)
- Document staff requirements for 1-2 year’s worth of goals (was 7.2 <-- remove after agreed placement)
- Compensation, incentive, and funding model (as appropriate), w. With a focus on defining compensation and incentives for incident responders as appropriate. Look at f, funding for tooling, compute, and governance. DWe will describe the support staff and comms, and also cover the benefits and guidelines for organizations “donating” staff. (was 7.3 <-- remove after agreed placement)
- Legal, service level, or contractual details including how to handle volunteers (Samaritan responders, foundation, maintainers), the service level regarding response and engagement times, the contractual details necessary to retain & sustain talent, tools, or services aimed at thein completion of the groups mission.
