## Summary
This section outlines the steps to collect feedback, existing precident, and good industry practices that are used to coordinate security vulnerabilities.  The goals and milestones outlined here help inform the creation of OSS-SIRT services in section 2 and ultimately the recruiting of the cohort as outlined in section 3.  Section 1 engages with upstream maintainers, security teams, and security researchers to tailor the capabilities the OSS-SIRt will ultimately deliver so they are fit-for-purpose and useful to the targted stakeholders.


## 1.1 Understand and Document the Problem Space

For the SIRT to narrow and define the breadth of services it will offer, we must first understand the current problems expressed by the various types of open source projects.

There is a wide range of security issues and complications that Open Source projects and maintainers consistently face. Therefore, we intend to lead with discussions with a diverse set of representative open source developers and security incident responders, paying particular attention to those with experience in managing the disclosure and remediation of high-impact vulnerabilities (such as log4j) in open source software.

From these discussions, we intend to create surveys to be distributed to a greater number of representative open source projects to help us better understand their needs.

## 1.2 Survey the SIRT's Intended Audience

After having a good intial understanding of the problems we're aiming to address (1.1), we will develop a set of questions to futher gather feedback and understanding from the SIRT's intended audience.

### Key Steps/Milestones

- [ ] **M1**: Develop Questions
- [ ] **M2**: Gather SIG Feedback
- [ ] **M3**: Coordination within OSSF SIGs
- [ ] **M4**: Solicit Feedback

- [ ] **M6**: Develop Report
- [ ] **M7**: Reviewing services (with the other SIRT streams)

### Time & Resource Estimate

This will require coordination with the OpenSSF to develop the survey based on this top level problem set. It will then require the SIG to comb through the analysis of this data set and develop a guiding report for development and feature-completeness of services.
